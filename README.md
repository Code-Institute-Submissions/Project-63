## Styed by Saoirse 

 Styled by Saoirse is a site that helps the user view and book hair styling sessions. The site will target both existing and potential customers and can show them images of previous work, price lists and how to contact. 
 My aim  is to have a site that can make the business look profesional and help boost customer experience.

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future I would introduce a section where the user can see an up to date calander on available times.
- In the future I would introduce a functioning booking system where the user can book a time slot which would go directly to the owners calander.

## Testing 

- In testing for this project i inisially came across a lot of issues on reactive viewing where some aspects of the page didnt react as i would have liked. through out trail and error i eventually got the page to react as i would have liked in different view points. 
I tried to focus on desktop and mobile view as i tought that these would be the most commenly used. 
I spent a lot of time trying to get the image slider to look its best, I found it quite time consuming and had to rely hevily on online videos and fourms for help. 
I also found myself going back through a lot of our lessons to get some infromation on how to center certin Divs and also on general layout of the page.

- I think the page looks best in desktop view and although mobile view works well it could look a lot better. If i had more time available to me i would spend it working out the kinks there. Overall I'm happy how the page turned out in terms of asteticts, but there's always room for improvment.

- Some of the more interesting bugs i came across working on the page came from adjusting for different viewpoints. When i had first incorperated the image slider it was a bit of a mess, the images would stack on top of each other, they would stretch and drag out the page and out of focus and sometimes just disapear. This was definetlly the biggest learning experience for me. Throught the testing of this I would ahve to go back through our online lessons, ask questions on online fourms, ask fellow students for advice and watch some YouTube videos with better information on hoe to propperly incorperate an image slider corretly. The image slider didn't turn out exactly how i would like, I know that it is a bit off center and could be a lot more clean looking.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
